# Text Representation Performance for Offensive Speech Detection
## Overview
This project aims to evaluate the performance of different text representation techniques—TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Sentence Transformers—on the task of detecting offensive speech in text data. By comparing these approaches, the project seeks to determine which method provides the most effective features for this classification task.

## Objectives
- Compare Text Representations:
  - Assess the effectiveness of TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Sentence Transformers in representing text data for the purpose of offensive speech detection.
- Model Training and Evaluation:
  - Train and evaluate machine learning models using each text representation to measure their performance in classifying offensive speech versus non-offensive content.
